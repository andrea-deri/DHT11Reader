# DHT11Reader
A bare-bone library for retrieve data from DHT11 sensor, without all the cumbersome stuff related to complex computation.
Useful for that projects where you need only a simple measuration of temperature and humidity. 

## Description
The library behaviour is adapted to the protocol of the DHT11 sensor, described in the PDF file included in this repo.  
The measured values can be read as floating point values directly from the class instance. 
See DHT11Reader.ino file for a working example.
